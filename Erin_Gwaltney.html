<h1>Erin Gwaltney - About Me</h1>
<p>One thing many people don't know about me is that I am a published artist! I have a graphite drawing published in the campus magazine Erato.</p>

<p>Everyone always asks me why I didn't go to art school, and the answer to that is that I simply didn't want to (now quit asking).</p>

<p>Another thing that people don't know about me is that, "OMG! DID YOU KNOW I STUDIED ABROAD IN IRELAND THIS SUMMER AND IT CHANGED MY LIFE?"</p>
<p>I was a part of the BME Galway program this past summer, and apparently I talk about it too often (at least according to my roommates). One of my favorite things that I saw while there was a group of cows just chillin' by the edge of a cliff on the Aran Islands.</p>

<p>Aren't they just the cutest little cliff cows you've ever seen? They did not care that there was a 300+ foot drop right next to them or that there were a lot of people milling about. Honestly, these cows are the definition of "chill" and I love it.</p>
