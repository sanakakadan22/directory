<h1 style ="background-color:SlateBlue;">Some facts about me...</h1>
<p>I have one older sister who works at Warner Bros. Television. My sister and I love movies and each spend entirely too much time on IMDB researching upcoming movies. My family name is Scottish. I was able to visit Melrose, Scotland when I studied abroad at Oxford. I painted my mortarboard with the rose from my ancient family crest. My attitude about the rest of the semester can be seen below.</p>
